    This function uses Fernet symmetric encryption from the cryptography library to secure the 
    provided credentials. A random encryption key is generated, and that key along with the 
    encrypted login, password, and server are saved to the specified file. The key and encrypted 
    values are stored on separate lines (binary format).

        login (str): The MT5 login credential. Note: even if the login is numeric, pass it as a string.
